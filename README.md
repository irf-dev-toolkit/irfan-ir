# 👋 Hi, I’m Irfan Rayachuru (@irfan-ir)
I am a full stack web developer with experience in Javascript, AngularJS, Angular, React, Node.js, Python, Mongo, and AWS.

I am passionate about building web applications that are fast, responsive, and easy to use. I have a strong foundation in front-end development, with a focus on creating user interfaces that are visually appealing and intuitive.

On the back-end, I have experience building and maintaining RESTful APIs using Node.js and Python. I have also worked with MongoDB and AWS to build scalable, cloud-based solutions.

I am always looking to learn new technologies and broaden my skillset, and I am excited to work on new and challenging projects.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
